# Getting Started with Create React App

# Maxwells Dogs

This is the front end of  a single page application that uses Javascript, JSX, Html, CSS, React, Sinatra and Ruby. It uses data from the backend through ORM framework to create and to manipulate objects in the databases.

On this page you can create a dog object, you can also delete a dog object. You can create walks for the dogs, delete walks for the dogs and edit walks for the dogs.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
